\description{
This contains the data from the skittle experiment conducted by
Nick Tierney. The goal of the experiment was to assess if people
can discern the flavour of the skittle (indicated by color of the skittle)
based on taste alone. The participants are blindfolded.

The experiment had 3 participants with each participant
tasting 10 skittles, 2 of each 5 color, in a random order.
