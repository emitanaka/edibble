## Release summary

This is a major internal change that the R6 class is completely changed to a Provenance class object that ensures a more consistent and cognitive access to internal structure. 

Other changes include the change of dependency to use `openxlsx2` instead of `openxlsx` and the change in print for the object with class `ebdl_table`.
