Description: A system to facilitate designing comparative experiments using the 
  grammar of experimental designs <https://emitanaka.org/edibble-book/>. 
  An experimental design is treated as an intermediate, mutable object that is 
  built progressively by fundamental experimental components like units, treatments, and their relation.
